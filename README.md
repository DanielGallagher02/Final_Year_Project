# Optimising Agricultural Outcomes with Computer Vision

## Project Overview
This project applies computer vision and transfer learning to enhance crop prediction. Developed as part of my BSc (Hons) in Computing, it aims to revolutionize small-scale farming by improving harvest accuracy and yield predictions.

## Implementation
The implementation is built around a Python-based framework that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning for image classification. Data is processed and analyzed through custom scripts, with model training and evaluation conducted using Jupyter notebooks.

## Getting Started
1. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Use `data_exploration.ipynb` for initial data assessment.
3. Define CNN models in `cnn_model.py` and try and employ transfer learning with `transfer_model.py`.
4. Execute `main.py` to start the workflow from preprocessing to evaluation.
