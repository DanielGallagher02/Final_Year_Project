# Optimising Agricultural Outcomes with Computer Vision

## Project Overview
This initiative harnesses the power of AI techniques, specifically advanced computer vision and transfer learning techniques, to revolutionize agricultural predictions. Crafted as an integral part of my BSc (Hons) in Computing, the project is designed to significantly enhance the accuracy of crop yield predictions and harvest outcomes, targeting the upliftment of small-scale farming practices.

## Implementation
The core of this project is a Python-based framework that may use the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) alongside transfer learning methodologies for the task of image classification. The approach is hands-on, involving data processing, with the bulk of model training and evaluation being carried out within Jupyter notebooks.
