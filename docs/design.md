# Draft Design Documentation

## Introduction
This section should briefly introduce the design considerations of my project, touching on the main objectives and how the design aligns with your research goals. I will also mention the importance of design in achieving the precision required for crop prediction models.

## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
Detail the hardware components selected for my project, including the MacBook Air M1 and DJI Mini SE drone, and justify why they were chosen with respect to their performance and suitability for the project.

### Software Requirements
List the software tools, platforms, and libraries I used, such as Python, TensorFlow, and various data processing libraries. I will  explain how they support the objectives of the project.

## Functional and Non-functional Requirements
Describe what the system is designed to do (functional requirements) and how it should perform under various conditions (non-functional requirements like performance, usability, reliability, etc.).

## Design Choices

### Model Training Resources
Explain the datasets, training techniques, and computational resources utilized for training your machine learning models.

### Justification of Selected Components
Provide a rationale behind the selection of specific hardware and software components, emphasizing how they contribute to achieving the project's goals.

## Prototype Development

### Design Prototype
Discuss the design of the prototype, including things like the architecture, user interface, and interaction flow.

### Flowchart Diagram
Include a flowchart to visually represent the system's workflow, showing the sequence of operations and decision-making processes.

## Validation and Adjustment Strategy
Outline the process for validating the model's accuracy, including any cross-validation techniques used and how accuracy targets were established and adjusted based on test results.

## Continuous Improvement and Transparency
Discuss the iterative improvement process and how transparency is maintained in reporting the model's accuracy.

## Conclusion
Summarize the design phase, reflecting on the choices made and discussing how the design lays the foundation for the subsequent testing and evaluation phases.
